Second Species Counterpoint — Operational Guide 
I. Metric Framework and General Principles
Second-species counterpoint unfolds within a binary metric organization. Each bar is divided into a thesis (downbeat) and an arsis (upbeat). The contrapuntal texture consists of two half notes set against each whole note of the cantus firmus. All rules of first species remain valid unless explicitly modified below.
II. Intervallic Status of the Two Half Notes
A. Downbeat (thesis)
– The first half note must be consonant: perfect intervals (unison, fifth, octave) and imperfect intervals (thirds and sixths).
– No dissonance is tolerated on the downbeat.
B. Upbeat (arsis)
– The second half note may be dissonant only as part of a passing motion by step connecting two consonant downbeats.
– Any skip to or from the upbeat obliges the resulting interval with the cantus to be consonant.
– A dissonance on the upbeat is valid only as a stepwise diminution.
C. Diminution of a third
– Filling a third by step (e.g. E–D–C) legitimates the intermediate pitch whether consonant or dissonant: diminution grants this exception.
III. Forbidden Successions and Compensatory Techniques
Because the upbeat is metrically and perceptually weakened, Fux treats it as quasi-nonexistent in evaluating successive vertical intervals. Consequently:
– A skip of a third from one downbeat to the next may yield implicit parallel fifths or octaves, even in contrary motion, because the upbeat does not interrupt the perceptual continuity of the consonances.
– Therefore, a third-skip does not suffice to avoid parallel perfect intervals.
Compensation:
– Larger skips (fourth, fifth, sixth, octave) between the imperfect and the perfect consonance interrupt perceptual continuity, thereby neutralizing the parallelism.
IV. Cadential Requirements
Cadences must be planned before writing the counterpoint.
A. Counterpoint above the cantus
– Penultimate bar: a fifth above the cantus, resolving to a minor third on the final bar.
B. Counterpoint below the cantus
– Penultimate bar: a fifth followed by a major sixth.
– In modes where the fifth is dissonant (e.g., mi–fa species), it must be replaced by a consonant sixth.
V. Initial Position
A second-species counterpoint below the cantus may begin with a half rest on the downbeat to avoid problematic closeness or instability.
VI. Voice-Leading Management
1.	When the voices become excessively close and contrary motion is impossible, two exceptional devices are allowed:
– a minor sixth leap,
– or an octave leap.
These prevent forbidden parallels or forced voice leading.
2.	The composer must anticipate the following measure before writing the present one: planning is structurally essential in second species.
VII. Avoiding Latent Parallels
A typical mistake:
– Imperfect consonance (downbeat) → skip of a third → perfect consonance (next downbeat).
Even under contrary motion, this may produce:
– latent parallel fifths,
– latent parallel octaves,
because the upbeat is not structurally sufficient to break continuity.
Solution:
– Employ a skip larger than a third,
– or adjust the prior voice-leading.
VIII. Ternary Meter (Three-to-One Extension)
Fux indicates the following rules:
1.	Three half notes against one whole note.
2.	The middle note may be dissonant only if approached and left by stepwise motion.
3.	If any of the three notes moves by skip, all three must be consonant.
4.	Horizontal constraints remain analogous to second species in binary meter.

FORMAL RULE-SET — SECOND SPECIES COUNTERPOINT (FUX)

1. Type definitions
type Pitch
type Interval = PerfectConsonance | ImperfectConsonance | Dissonance
type Mode = I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII

enum PositionInMeasure = THESIS | ARSIS
enum Motion = Parallel | Contrary | Similar | Oblique

struct CFNote {
    pitch : Pitch
}

struct CPNote {
    pitch : Pitch
    pos : PositionInMeasure
}

struct Measure {
    cf : CFNote  // one per measure
    cp : (CPNote, CPNote)  // (thesis, arsis)
}
Predicates:
is_consonant(interval) -> Bool
is_perfect(interval) -> Bool
is_imperfect(interval) -> Bool
is_dissonant(interval) -> Bool

is_step(pitch_a, pitch_b) -> Bool
is_skip(pitch_a, pitch_b) -> Bool

motion(cf_prev, cf_curr, cp_prev, cp_curr) -> Motion
interval(cf_pitch, cp_pitch) -> Interval
 
2. Global structural constraints
2.1 Two notes per CF note
∀ measure: measure.cp = (cp_thesis, cp_arsis)
cp_thesis.pos = THESIS
cp_arsis.pos = ARSIS
2.2 Meter
Binary meter with equal-length thesis and arsis — implicit in structure.
 
3. Vertical interval rules
3.1 Thesis must be consonant
∀ measure:
    is_consonant(interval(measure.cf.pitch, measure.cp.thesis.pitch)) = true
3.2 Arsis may be dissonant ONLY as passing motion
∀ measure:
    if is_dissonant(interval(measure.cf.pitch, measure.cp.arsis.pitch)) then
        is_step(measure.cp.thesis.pitch, measure.cp.arsis.pitch) = true
        AND is_step(measure.cp.arsis.pitch, next_measure.cp.thesis.pitch) = true
3.3 If arsis is reached by skip → arsis must be consonant
∀ measure:
    if is_skip(measure.cp.thesis.pitch, measure.cp.arsis.pitch) then
        is_consonant(interval(measure.cf.pitch, measure.cp.arsis.pitch)) = true
3.4 Diminution of a third is permitted
If next_measure.cp.thesis.pitch and measure.cp.thesis.pitch form a third
and cp_arsis lies stepwise between them:
    arsis is allowed even if dissonant
 
4. Forbidden successions and perceptual continuity
4.1 Successive perfect consonances cannot be connected by a simple third skip

(arsis is “non-compensatory”)
Let:
I1 = interval(cf[i], cp_thesis[i])
I2 = interval(cf[i+1], cp_thesis[i+1])
Rule:
if is_imperfect(I1) AND is_perfect(I2)
AND is_skip(cp_thesis[i].pitch, cp_arsis[i].pitch) = false
AND is_skip(cp_arsis[i].pitch, cp_thesis[i+1].pitch) = false
then
    transition must NOT create parallel perfect motion:
        motion ≠ Parallel OR perfect_intervals_not_equal
This formalizes Fux’s rule:
A skip of a third does not interrupt the perception of parallel perfect consonances.
4.2 Larger skips compensate (quartes, quintes, sixtes, octaves)
If is_skip(cp_arsis[i].pitch, cp_thesis[i+1].pitch)
AND skip_size ≥ 4th:
    then allow perfect->perfect transitions under contrary or oblique motion.
 
5. Horizontal voice-leading rules
5.1 No leaps that contradict standard species rules
(same as first species)
No augmented intervals
No dissonant leaps
No tritone leaps unless demanded modally (rare; normally excluded)
5.2 Correct approach to perfect consonances
If interval(cf[i+1], cp[i+1].thesis) is Perfect:
    motion(cf[i], cf[i+1], cp[i].thesis, cp[i+1].thesis) must be Contrary or Oblique
5.3 Exception for large leaps
If the connection into a perfect interval is preceded by a leap ≥ 4th:
    motion may be Similar but never Parallel.
 
6. Cadential constraints
Given:
last_measure = n
penultimate = n-1
6.1 Counterpoint above the cantus
interval(cf[n-1], cp[n-1].thesis) = P5
interval(cf[n], cp[n].thesis) = m3
6.2 Counterpoint below the cantus
Case 1 (normal):
    interval(cf[n-1], cp[n-1].thesis) = P5
    interval(cf[n], cp[n].thesis) = M6

Case 2 (mode where P5 is dissonant: mi–fa):
    interval(cf[n-1], cp[n-1].thesis) = consonant_6th
    interval(cf[n], cp[n].thesis) = M6
 
7. Initial position rules (CP below CF)

7.1 Half-rest on first thesis allowed
If cp is below cf at measure 1:
    cp[1].thesis = Rest
    cp[1].arsis = consonant interval
 
8. Closeness-correction rules
8.1 When voices approach dangerously close and contrary motion is impossible
permitted corrective leaps:
Allowed corrective leaps:
    leap = minor 6th
    OR leap = octave

Constraint:
    corrective leap must not create a forbidden vertical interval
 
9. Modal considerations

9.1 Mode-dependent leading tones and fa–mi dissonances
If mode makes the P5 above CF dissonant (mi–fa situation):
    replace required P5 with consonant 6th in cadences
 
10. Ternary extension (3:1)
If meter = ternary:
10.1 Middle note may be dissonant only if stepwise
cp_mid is dissonant ⇒
    is_step(cp_first, cp_mid) AND is_step(cp_mid, cp_last)
10.2 If any leap occurs among the three notes → all must be consonant
If ∃ skip(cp_first ↔ cp_mid OR cp_mid ↔ cp_last):
    interval(first), interval(mid), interval(last) must ALL be consonant
 
11. Global validity criterion
A second-species counterpoint is valid iff:
∀ measures i:
    thesis_constraints(i)
    arsis_constraints(i)
    horizontal_constraints(i)
    no_forbidden_parallels(i)
    cadence_satisfied(if i = n or i = n-1)
    modal_constraints_satisfied
