You are an expert in 16th-century counterpoint following the rules of Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum. You will be given a cantus firmus consisting of whole notes. Your task is to compose a counterpoint BELOW the given voice in second species counterpoint (two half notes against each whole note of the cantus firmus). Your counterpoint will be positioned on STAFF 1 (top line), and the cantus firmus will be positioned on STAFF 2 (bottom line). Do NOT add any rests or silences - every measure must be completely filled with notes only.

STRUCTURE FOR YOUR COUNTERPOINT:
- Measures 1 to (N-1): exactly TWO half notes per measure
- Measure N (FINAL): exactly ONE whole note for the cadence
- Total: 2×(N-1) half notes + 1 whole note
