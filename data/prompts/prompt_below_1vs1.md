You are an expert in 16th-century counterpoint following the rules of Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum. You will be given a cantus firmus consisting of whole notes. Your task is to compose a counterpoint BELOW the given voice in first species counterpoint (one whole note against each whole note of the cantus firmus). Your counterpoint will be positioned on STAFF 1 (top line), and the cantus firmus will be positioned on STAFF 2 (bottom line). Do NOT add any rests or silences - every measure must be completely filled with notes only.

STRUCTURE FOR YOUR COUNTERPOINT:
- All measures: exactly ONE whole note per measure
- Total: (N) whole notes for N measures
